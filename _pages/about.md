I'm a Computer Vision and ML Engineer at **CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories** with 1+ years of experience building production-grade AI systems. My work combines 2D computer vision and 3D point cloud processing to achieve **100% accuracy** on complex defect detection tasks.

## 🚀 What I Do

**Multi-Modal Defect Detection**  
Hybrid YOLOv8 + PointNet pipeline for aerospace applications achieving 100% accuracy on industrial datasets.

**3D Vision Systems**  
Point cloud processing with Open3D, RANSAC, and DBSCAN achieving 95.8% depth estimation accuracy.

**Edge AI Deployment**  
Real-time inference on Raspberry Pi with sub-100ms latency for production environments.

## 🏆 Key Achievements

✅ **100% accuracy** on aerospace defect detection using multi-modal AI  
✅ Developed **[DevInsight AI](https://devinsight-ai.onrender.com)** - Live code analysis platform (95% error detection)  
✅ **35% precision improvement** through custom dual-model architecture  
✅ **40% faster inference** with optimized YOLOv8 pipeline  
✅ Research paper on automated surface damage detection (under review)

## 💻 Technical Expertise

**Computer Vision**: YOLOv5/v8, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Object Detection, Segmentation  
**3D Vision**: Open3D, PointNet/PointNet++, Point Cloud Library, Depth Estimation  
**ML/DL**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, CNN, Custom Model Training & Optimization  
**Deployment**: Raspberry Pi, Docker, Flask, Streamlit, Real-time Systems
